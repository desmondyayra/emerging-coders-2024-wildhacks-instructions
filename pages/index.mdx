# Building a Node.js Todo App with Firebase Integration

## Setting Up Node.js and Firebase

To get started, let's install Node.js and set up a Firebase database for our Todo App.

### Installing Node.js

1. Install Node.js by downloading the installer from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and following the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Verify that Node.js is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

```sh
node --version
```


### Setting Up a Node.js Project

1. Create a new directory for your Node.js project in your preferred location.

2. Navigate to the newly created directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```sh
npm init
```





## Creating a Firebase Database

Now, let's create a Firebase project and set up a Firestore database.

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. Follow the instructions to set up your Firebase project and enable Firestore as the database.

### Installing Firebase Admin SDK

1. Install the Firebase Admin SDK in your Node.js project by running the following command in your terminal:


```sh
npm install firebase-admin
```


### Connecting Your App to Firebase

Create a `firebase.js` file in your project directory with the following content:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const serviceAccount = require('./credentials.json');

admin.initializeApp({
    credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
});

const db = admin.firestore();

module.exports = db;
```
